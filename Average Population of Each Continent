Given the CITY and COUNTRY tables, query the names of all the continents (COUNTRY.Continent) and their respective average city populations (CITY.Population) rounded down to the nearest integer.

Note: CITY.CountryCode and COUNTRY.Code are matching key columns.



SELECT
    CO.Continent,FLOOR(avg(CI.population))
FROM
    COUNTRY CO
JOIN
    CITY CI
ON
    CO.CODE=CI.COUNTRYCODE
GROUP BY
    CO.Continent;
